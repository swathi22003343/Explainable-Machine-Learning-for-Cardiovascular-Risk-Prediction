# Explainable Machine Learning for Cardiovascular Risk Prediction

## Project Overview

The Explainable Cardiovascular Risk Prediction System is a machine learning-based web application designed to predict the likelihood of cardiovascular disease using clinical input parameters. The system provides not only a classification result but also a probability score and an explanation of contributing risk factors.

The application is built using Python and Flask for backend development and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend interface. The machine learning model is trained using a structured cardiovascular dataset and deployed through a responsive web interface accessible across multiple platforms.

This system is intended to assist in early-stage cardiovascular risk assessment and support informed decision-making.

## Objectives

Develop an accurate machine learning model for heart disease prediction

Provide probability-based risk estimation

Identify and display key contributing factors

Deliver explainable prediction results

Build a cross-platform web interface

Support early diagnosis and preventive healthcare

## System Architecture

The system consists of the following components:

User Interface (Frontend)

Flask Backend Server

Pre-trained Machine Learning Model

Data Preprocessing (Scaling)

Risk Interpretation Module

Workflow:

User Input → Data Preprocessing → Model Prediction → Probability Calculation → Risk Interpretation → Display Results

## Technologies Used

### Backend

Python

Flask

Scikit-learn

NumPy

Pandas

Joblib

### Frontend

HTML5

CSS3

JavaScript

Machine Learning

StandardScaler for feature normalization

## Features

Cardiovascular risk classification (Low / Moderate / High)

Risk probability percentage

Identification of contributing clinical features

Text-based explanation of prediction

Medical recommendation output

Responsive interface (Windows, macOS, Android, iOS compatible)

## Dataset

The model is trained using a publicly available cardiovascular dataset containing the following attributes:

Age

Sex

Chest Pain Type (cp)

Resting Blood Pressure (trestbps)

Cholesterol (chol)

Fasting Blood Sugar (fbs)

Resting ECG (restecg)

Maximum Heart Rate (thalach)

Exercise Induced Angina (exang)

ST Depression (oldpeak)

Slope

Number of Major Vessels (ca)

Thalassemia (thal)

## Model Performance

Evaluation metrics:

F1-Score

The model performance may vary depending on dataset distribution and input conditions.

## Core Backend Code (app.py)

```
from flask import Flask, render_template, request
import numpy as np
import joblib

app = Flask(__name__)

model = joblib.load("heart_model.pkl")
scaler = joblib.load("scaler.pkl")

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return render_template('index.html')

@app.route('/predict', methods=['POST'])
def predict():
    features = [float(x) for x in request.form.values()]
    final_input = np.array(features).reshape(1, -1)
    final_input = scaler.transform(final_input)

    prediction = model.predict(final_input)[0]
    probability = model.predict_proba(final_input)[0][1] * 100

    if probability < 30:
        risk = "Low Risk"
        recommendation = "All parameters appear within normal range. Maintain a healthy lifestyle."
    elif probability < 60:
        risk = "Moderate Risk"
        recommendation = "Some parameters indicate potential cardiovascular stress. Medical consultation recommended."
    else:
        risk = "High Risk"
        recommendation = "High probability of cardiovascular disease detected. Immediate medical attention is advised."

    return render_template(
        'result.html',
        risk=risk,
        probability=round(probability, 2),
        recommendation=recommendation
    )

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)

```

## Limitations

Performance depends on dataset quality

Not a replacement for professional medical diagnosis

Requires accurate clinical input values

May not generalize perfectly to unseen data

## Future Enhancements

Integration of SHAP-based explainability

Deployment on cloud platforms

Mobile application development

Integration with hospital information systems

Real-time monitoring using wearable devices

## Ethical Considerations

This system is designed for educational and research purposes. Predictions generated by this system must be validated by qualified healthcare professionals before making clinical decisions.
